# odl-meetup-vm
This repo has a Vagrant setup for creating a VM to run OpenDaylight Lithium with Mininet.

I tested this against VirtualBox 4.3.r26 and Vagrant for MAC OSX 1.7.2. It requires a 
machine that's capable of providing at least 4GB of RAM to the VM, and one CPU. You can
create and launch the VM simply by installing the VirtualBox and Vagrant software,
cloning this repo, and doing:

    vagrant up

You'll want two ssh sessions into the VM after it's up. You can ssh into the VM
just by doing

    vagrant ssh

from this directory. Once in, you'll want to start the OpenDaylight controller in
one of the ssh sessions. You can do this by running the following commands:

    cd distribution-karaf-0.3.1-Lithium-SR1/bin/
    rm -rf ../snapshots/ ../journal/ ../data/*
    ./karaf clean

Note: you'll probably see a message sayig "karaf: JAVA_HOME not set; results may vary".
This is just a warning, and things should work fine.

                                                                                           
<p>You should see the following banner appear:</p>

    Hit '<tab>' for a list of available commands
    and '[cmd] --help' for help on a specific command.
    Hit '<ctrl-d>' or type 'system:shutdown' or 'logout' to shutdown OpenDaylight.


<p>At the karaf console, enter the following<p>


     opendaylight-user@root>feature:install odl-l2switch-switch-ui
     opendaylight-user@root>log:tail | grep L2SwitchMainModule


You should eventually see the following:

     L2SwitchMain (instance org....) initialized.


<p>From the other ssh window, launch mininet with three switches:</p>
     sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 --mac --topo=linear,3 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13
    *** Creating network
    *** Adding controller
    *** Adding hosts:
    h1 h2 h3 
    *** Adding switches:
    s1 s2 s3 
    *** Adding links:
    (h1, s1) (h2, s2) (h3, s3) (s1, s2) (s2, s3) 
    *** Configuring hosts
    h1 h2 h3 
    *** Starting controller
    *** Starting 3 switches
    s1 s2 s3 
    *** Starting CLI:
    mininet>

<p>Open a web browser and navigate to http://192.168.50.70:8181/index.html (username/password is admin/admin)<p>

You should be able to see three openflow switches, labeled openflow:1, openflow:2, and openflow:3

<p>Use the pingall command in mininet to allow the controller to discover all of the hosts:</p>

    mininet> pingall
    *** Ping: testing ping reachability
    h1 -> h2 h3 
    h2 -> h1 h3 
    h3 -> h1 h2 
    *** Results: 0% dropped (6/6 received)
    mininet> 

<p>You can then hit the reload button on your web browser, and the hosts should now appear</p>
